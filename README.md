# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements a Decision Tree classifier for predicting heart disease based on patient medical data.

## Project Structure
- `data/` Contains the dataset file `heart.csv`.
- `src/` Main source code including data processing, model training, and evaluation (`main.py`).
- `models/` Contains saved machine learning models.
- `results/` Evaluation reports and plots visualization.
- `requirements.txt` Python dependencies file.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including encoding categorical features and scaling numeric features.
- Training and testing Decision Tree model.
- Visualizing results via confusion matrix and classification metrics.
- Saving trained model for reuse.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/mohamedhachimi56/HeartDiseasePredictor.git
2. Navigate to project directory and install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python script/main.py
   
## Results
- The model achieves around 80% accuracy in predicting heart disease.
- Results including accuracy reports and confusion matrix are saved in the `results/` folder.
